# Sql Upgrade Scripts

EF Core can automatically upgrade the database when you run Fanray of a new version, but some people prefer applying changes with sql scripts, thus I provide them here as an alternative.

Always backup your existing database before each upgrade, then review and execute the correct .sql script for your installation.

## 1.0-2.0.sql

Upgrade Fanray from v1.0 to v2.0.
